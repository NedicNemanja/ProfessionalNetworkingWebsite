Nemanja:
My tasks included connecting the stack (nginx server - uWSGI - Django -
Database), implementing the back end as well as providing asynchronous
functionality with jquery/ajax. I (successfully) experimented with
various security measures such as Session Security, SSL/HTTPS, CSRF
protection, SQL injection protection. I also enjoyed developing a Cluster
Collaborative Filtering recommender system for user posts.
